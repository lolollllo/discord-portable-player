# Hello
This document is for people who want to contribute to this project!

# Code Style

## Formatting
We are using **[Prettier](https://prettier.io)** to format the code.

## File names
- Always use `PascalCase` for the files containing classes (example: `Queue`, `Track`, `Player` etc.)

## Some Rules
- Use `camelCase` for `Function names`, `Variables`, etc. and `PascalCase` for `Class name`
- Do not make unused variables/imports
- Don't forget to write `JSDOC` for each property and method
- Use English language

# Pull Requests
- Use English language
- Explain what your update does
- Run `npm run docs:test` command to make sure documentation is working
- Format the code properly with `npm run format`
