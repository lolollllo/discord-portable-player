# Code Style

## Formatting
We are using **[Prettier](https://prettier.io)** to format the code.

## File names
- Always use `PascalCase` for the files containing classes (example: `Queue`, `Track`, `Player` etc.)

## Some Rules
- Use `camelCase` for `Function names`, `Variables`, etc. and `PascalCase` for `Class name`.
- Do not make unused variables/imports.
- Don't forget to write `JSDOC` for each property and method.
- Use English.

# Pull Requests
- Use English.
- Explain why your PR should be merged.
- Run `npm run docs:test` to make sure documentation is working.
- Format the code properly with `npm run format`.
