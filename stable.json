(Note that only `string` queries are passed to your extractor)\n\n - `getInfo(query): object`\n   \n   This method is used by Discord Player to create `Track` object. You can return your data here that gets passed to `Track`.\n   Your info must be similar to this:\n\n    ```js\n    {\n        // the title\n        title: \"Extracted by custom extractor\",\n        // the duration in ms\n        duration: 20000,\n        // the thumbnail\n        thumbnail: \"some thumbnail link\",\n        // engine, can be Readable streams or link to raw stream that gets played\n        engine: \"someStreamLink\",\n        // number of views\n        views: 0,\n        // author of this stream\n        author: \"Some Artist\",\n        // description\n        description: \"\",\n        // link of this stream\n        url: \"Some Link\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n - `version: string`\n\n   This should be the version of your extractor.

It is a different concept from extractors, where you are **just** downloading\nstreams. `source` here will be a video source. Streams from `onBeforeCreateStream` are then piped to `FFmpeg` and finally sent to Discord voice servers.\n\n# FAQ\n## How can I remove this?\n\n> If you already made this change and want to switch to default mode in runtime,\n> you can set `queue.onBeforeCreateStream` to `null` which will make `discord-portable-player` use default config.\n\n## Which stream format should I return?\n\n> It's not necessary to return opus format or whatever, since every streams have to be converted to s16le, due to inline volume.\n\n## Can I use ytdl-core-discord?\n\n> Yes, you can.\n\n## Can I use this for other sources, like soundcloud?\n\n> Absolutely.\n\n## This is not working properly\n\n> `onBeforeCreateStream` may not work properly if you have `spotifyBridge` enabled (enabled by default).\n","path":"docs/extractors/create_stream.md"}}},"faq":{"name":"FAQ","files":{"custom_filters":{"name":"Custom Filters","type":"md","content":"# How to add custom audio filters?\n\nAudio filters in **Discord Portable Player** are **[FFmpeg audio filters](http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-all.html#Audio-Filters)**.

Discord Player uses `Queue` to assign queue manager to individual guild.\nWhich means each guild will have its own queue object. Every player action has to go through the `Queue` object for example, `play`, `pause`, `volume` etc.\n\n- When `Player` is initialized, it creates a cache to store external extractors or queues information. Queue is created by calling `createQueue` method of `Player` instance.\nA client should have only one `Player` instance, otherwise it will be complicated to track queues and other metadata.\n\n- Searching tracks can be done via `search` method of `Player` instance. Discord Player offers `search engine` option to target specific searches. Discord Player first\ncalls all the registered extractors first with the search query. If all external extractors failed to validate the query, player then passes the query to built-in extractors.\nInvalid or unknown queries may return `arbitrary` result.\n\n- The track result obtained from `search` can be loaded into `Queue` by calling `queue.addTrack`/`queue.addTracks`/`queue.play`.\n\n- Player calls `onBeforeCreateStream` if user has enabled the function while creating queue. This method runs each time before stream is downloaded. Users may use it\nto modify how and which stream will be played.\n\n- Queue is based on FIFO method (First In First Out)\n\n- Final stream is a pcm format, required for volume controls which is created by Discord Player itself.\n\n- Since inline volume is enabled by default for volume controls, you may face more resource usage.\n\n- You can disable inline volume for better performance but setting volume won't work and current volume will always be 100.\n\n- All the audio filters are handled by FFmpeg and stream has to reload in order to update filters.\n","path":"docs/faq/how_does_it_work.md"},"common_errors":{"name":"Common Errors","type":"md","content":"# Common Errors\n\nIn this section, we'll show you how to fix some common
